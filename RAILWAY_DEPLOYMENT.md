### Step 2: Create New Project (1 minute)

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your repository: **mooreronell-ui/underwritepro1**
4. Railway will start analyzing your project

---

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database (1 minute)

1. In your project dashboard, click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add PostgreSQL"
2. Railway will automatically:

3. Done! No manual configuration needed

---

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables (2 minutes)

1. Click on your web service (not the database)
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable" and add these:

```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=eb89a45acdfc2a2fa7e24ebe35b0ea01288be0355a45a078d37e8cd712ae6565
PORT=8000
```

**Note**: DATABASE_URL is already set automatically by Railway!

---

### Step 5: Deploy (3 minutes)

1. Railway automatically starts deploying after you add variables
2. Watch the build logs in real-time
3. Wait for "Build successful" and "Deployment live"
4. You'll see a URL like: `https://underwritepro1-production.up.railway.app`

---

### Step 6: Generate Public URL (1 minute)

1. Click on your web service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Networking"
4. Click "Generate Domain"
5. Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

## Environment Variables Summary

### Required (Set these):
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=eb89a45acdfc2a2fa7e24ebe35b0ea01288be0355a45a078d37e8cd712ae6565
PORT=8000
```

### Auto-Configured by Railway:
```
DATABASE_URL=(automatically set when you add PostgreSQL)
```

### Optional (Add later for full features):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=(your OpenAI API key)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=(your Stripe secret key)
```

## Cost Breakdown

### Railway Pricing:
- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month (enough for testing)
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month for web service
- **PostgreSQL**: Included in Hobby plan
- **Total**: ~$5/month (vs $14/month on Render)

### Usage Estimates:
- Small traffic: Free tier is enough
- Medium traffic: $5-10/month
- High traffic: $20-30/month

## Deployment Timeline

```
00:00 - Click "New Project"
00:30 - Select GitHub repo
01:00 - Add PostgreSQL database
02:00 - Set environment variables
02:30 - Railway starts building
04:00 - Build completes
04:30 - Deployment live
05:00 - Generate public domain
05:30 - Visit your app! ‚úÖ
```

**Total Time: ~5-6 minutes**

---

## After Deployment

### 1. Test Your App
- Visit your Railway URL
- You should see the login page
- API docs at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/docs`

### 2. Create First User
```bash
# Use the API docs or curl:
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "full_name": "Admin User",
    "organization_name": "My Company"
  }'
```

### 3. Add Optional Services (Later)
- **OpenAI API Key**: For AI bots
- **Stripe Keys**: For subscription management
- **Custom Domain**: Point your domain to Railway

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs for specific error
- Verify all files are in GitHub
- Ensure requirements.txt is in root directory

### Can't Access App
- Make sure you generated a public domain
- Check that PORT=8000 is set
- Verify deployment is "Active"

### Database Connection Error
- Ensure PostgreSQL database is added
- Check that DATABASE_URL exists in variables
- Restart the deployment

### App Crashes on Startup
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify JWT_SECRET_KEY is set
- Ensure all environment variables are correct
