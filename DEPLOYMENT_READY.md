## Required Environment Variables on Render

You MUST set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

### Essential (Required for deployment):
```
DATABASE_URL=<auto-filled by Render PostgreSQL>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
PORT=8000
```

### Optional (for full features):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your Stripe secret key>
REDIS_URL=<if you add Redis>
```

## Deployment Steps on Render

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables
1. Go to your Render service dashboard
2. Click "Environment" in the left sidebar
3. Add these variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` = (generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - `PORT` = `8000`
   - `DATABASE_URL` = (will be auto-filled when you add PostgreSQL)

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database
1. Click "New +" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
2. Name it "underwritepro-db"
3. Select the free tier
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Go back to your web service
6. In Environment tab, the DATABASE_URL should now be auto-filled

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete
3. Check logs for "UnderwritePro SaaS started successfully"

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Visit your Render URL (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com)
2. You should see the UnderwritePro login page
3. Test the API at: https://your-app.onrender.com/docs

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for the specific error message
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure JWT_SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL are set
3. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL database is created and connected
4. **Build Logs**: Check if all packages installed successfully

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found"**
- All dependencies are in requirements.txt
- This should not happen now

**"Database connection failed"**
- Make sure PostgreSQL database is created
- Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly

**"Port already in use"**
- Render handles this automatically
- Make sure PORT=8000 is set

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Create Admin User**: Use the /api/auth/register endpoint
2. **Test Features**: Try creating a deal, uploading documents
3. **Add OpenAI Key**: For AI bot features
4. **Add Stripe Keys**: For subscription features
5. **Custom Domain**: Add your own domain in Render settings

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the Render deployment logs
